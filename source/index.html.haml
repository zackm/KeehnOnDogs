      %h3 LAST CHANCE AT LIFE (LCAL) – ALL BREED RESCUE
      So many animals need our help! Judy volunteers her foster care and training services to LCAL - one dog at a time – to help them train  and find great homes for their dogs. Some simply need manners and obedience training, yet many others need to work through  behavorial problems such as trust, fearfulness, aggression and socialization issues. Being in a calm and loving foster environment allows  a dog to relax and learn at it's own pace. Even if it’s only possible to foster and train ONE dog at a time, it's one more dog that will  eventually find a great permanent home! Please check out these wonderful dogs who are available for adoption at LCAL.

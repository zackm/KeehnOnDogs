      %div
        We make coming to class for obedience training FUN! Learn how to motivate your dog through positive reinforcement games and natural rewards so he will love working on obedience commands for you. We discuss behavior, work on good manners and teach basic commands such as Sit, Down, Stay, Come, Leave It, Loose Leash Walking and a trick or two. Your dog will learn to enjoy off leash socialization and play politely with other dogs. Students are always welcome to bring their dog-related questions to class.
      FEE FOR THIS CLASS: $175/6 weeks
